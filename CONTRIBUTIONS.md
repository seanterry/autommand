# Contribution Guidelines
This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to the project. It includes coding standards, project structure,
and other important information to help you get started.

## AI assistants
AI assistants (like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) may be used to help write code, documentation, and tests.
However, any code generated by an AI assistant must be reviewed and approved by a human before being committed to the
repository. The human reviewer is responsible for ensuring that the generated code meets the project's standards and
guidelines.

Include this file as context when using AI assistants to generate code.

## Technologies
The solution is built with the .NET 9.0 SDK and intended to run on .NET 8.0 or later.
It uses C# as the primary programming language, preferring the latest language features.

## Code conventions

### Primary constructors
Prefer primary constructor syntax for classes with only one constructor. Treat primary constructor arguments as
read-only without exception. Any contribution that modifies the value of a primary constructor argument will be
rejected out of hand.

### General code style
Prioritize code performance and reliability above all else. Try to also make it easy to read and maintain.
Where those goals conflict, prioritize performance and reliability and thoroughly document what the code does and why
it is written that way.
